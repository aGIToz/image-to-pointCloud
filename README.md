# image-to-pointCloud

At times I need very simple textured based pointclouds to do stuff like denoising, segmentation etc. This simple project aims 
to convert simple textured based images to 3d point clouds with some distortion.


# Results

> Here see that how I converted the lena image into 3d point-cloud.
